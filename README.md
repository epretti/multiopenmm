MultiOpenMM: Flexible parallel molecular dynamics with OpenMM
=============================================================

MultiOpenMM is a package that enables setting up and running parallel molecular
dynamics simulations, including but not limited to replica exchange simulations,
using the OpenMM molecular simulation package.  MultiOpenMM supports running
independent simulations of multiple, possibly topologically distinct, molecular
systems, within a single OpenMM context.
